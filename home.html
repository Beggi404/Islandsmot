                    Poverty and hunger are two interconnected issues that continue to affect millions of people worldwide. Poverty is the lack of sufficient resources and income to meet basic needs, while hunger is the physical sensation of discomfort or weakness resulting from lack of food.
                </p>
                <p class="text-xs w-80 mt-3 font-medium">
                    Poverty can lead to hunger because individuals and families living in poverty often struggle to afford nutritious food. They may have to make difficult choices between buying food and paying for other necessities such as housing, healthcare, and education. Additionally, poverty can also limit access to clean water and sanitation, leading to malnutrition and disease.
